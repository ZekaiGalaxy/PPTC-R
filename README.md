# PPTCR

PowerPoint Task Completion-Robustness (**PPTC-R**) is a benchmark that measures LLMsâ€™ robustness to the user instruction and Powerpoint software version. The benchmark focuses on two main aspects: robustness to user instructions and robustness to software version changes. It introduces adversarial user instructions that challenge LLMs at **Sentence, Semantic, and Language levels**. It also examines LLMs' adaptability to software version changes by manipulating the available APIs, including an **API update** and **API lack** setting.

We establish our code based on [PPTC](https://github.com/gydpku/PPTC). This repository contains data and code for PPTCR. To evaluate your LLM or LLM-based AI assistant system, you should follow the following instructions.

## Environemnt Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ZekaiGalaxy/PPTCR; cd PPTCR
conda create -n pptcr python=3.10
conda activate pptcr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## LLM Setup

Please refer to the instructions in [PPTC](https://github.com/gydpku/PPTC) and setup the api for both close-sourced and open-sourced models.

## Data Preparation

We provide the raw file of sentence-level, semantic-level, language-level perturbation settings as well as api version perturbation. To generate the benchmark, please follow the following guide:

```
bash PPTCR_test_input/json_file.sh
python main.py --prepare --dataset [long/short] --[perturbation settings]
```
the perturbation settings include:
```
--noisy: semantic-level
--robust --robust_num=[0/1/2/3]: sentence-level
--language=[Arabic/Bulgarian/Chinese/French/German/Greek/Hindi/
            Russian/Spanish/Swahili/Thai/Turkish/Urdu/Vietnamese]: language-level
--api_lack: api version
--api_update: api version
```
