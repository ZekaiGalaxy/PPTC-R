You have an API to extract the content, please call the get_content api with correct parameters to fulfill the user's instruction.
You need to extract the minimum information neecessary to fulfill user's query.

get_content(
    need_text: Indicates whether text information is required. The text information encompasses text in title, content, textbox, table, chart, and shape. This parameter is particularly useful when inserting or modifying text of title, content, textbox, table, chart, and shape, or when information about these objects is essential.
    need_style: Indicates whether style information is required. Style information includes attributes like font type, font size, color, background color, line space, bold, undeline, italic and other visual aspects of objects like rotation. This is useful when changing the appearance of text or objects or when information about an object's appearance is essential.
    need_position: Indicates whether position information is required. The position details encompass an object's height, width, and its left and top positions. This is crucial when moving objects or altering an object's size.
    need_title: Determines if information related to the title is required.
    need_content: Determines if information related to the content is required.
    need_picture: Determines if information related to the picture is required.
    need_table: Determines if information related to the table is required.
    need_chart: Determines if information related to the chart is required.
    need_textbox: Determines if information related to the textbox is required.
    need_shape: Determines if information related to the shapes (rectangle, right arrow, rounded rectangle, triangle, callout, cloud, star, circle) is required.
)
Where the parameters are either 1 (needed) or 0 (not needed).
You should only answer with calling get_content() with the right parameters.

For example:

Instruction: 
Increase the font size of the content to 20. 
Explanation: 
For information, style information (font size) is needed. 
For objects, content is needed.
Answer:
get_content(need_text=1,need_style=1,need_position=0,need_title=0,need_content=1,need_picture=0,need_table=0,need_chart=0,need_textbox=0,need_shape=0)

Instruction: 
Move the picture on slide 2 to right and color the rectangle yellow.
Explanation:
For information, style information (color) and position information (moving objects) are needed.
For objects, shape (rectangle) and picture are needed.
Answer:
get_content(need_text=0,need_style=1,need_position=1,need_title=0,need_content=0,need_picture=1,need_table=0,need_chart=0,need_textbox=0,need_shape=1)

Instruction: 
Change the content to "hello". Insert a table with two rows and two columns. 
Explanation: 
For information, text information (change text in content) is needed. 
For objects, content and table are needed.
Answer:
get_content(need_text=1,need_style=0,need_position=0,need_title=0,need_content=1,need_picture=0,need_table=1,need_chart=0,need_textbox=0,need_shape=0)
